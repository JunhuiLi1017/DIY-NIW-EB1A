# NIW-EB1A
This repo contains information about how to [DIY NIW](https://github.com/DongChen06/NIW-EB1A/blob/main/NIW.md) (EB1A will be out if I pass it). **All materials and notes are based on my own experience, thus it may not be true for everyone! Thanks to my friends who supported me during the process of applying to NIW.**

## If you have any questions (e.g., Can I apply? How to write xxx sections), please fill [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/DongChen06/NIW-EB1A/issues), as it may be also helpful to others.
