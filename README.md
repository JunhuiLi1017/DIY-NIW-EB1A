# NIW-EB1A
This repo contains information about how to DIY NIW (EB1A will be out if I pass it). **All materials and notes are based on my own experience, thus it may not be true for everyone! If you have any questions, please file an issue on Github, since it may be also helpful to others. Thanks to my friends who supported me during the process of applying to NIW.**

# Common Questions?
- **Why DIY for NIW**: it is easier than writing an academic paper.
- **How long will it take**: it takes about 1 week to 1 month to prepare the materials (excluding the waiting time for recommendation letters). For myself, I have 460 citations, so it took me more than 2 weeks to finish.
- **When should I start**: Paper >= 2~3 (at least 1 first author), citations >= 20, reviews >= 10.
